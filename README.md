## 🧠 Inspiration

Every student has faced this moment:

- Exam is very close  
- Too many topics  
- Mind feels blank  
- Don’t know **what to study first**

Most study apps assume you have **time and discipline**.  
But what if you don’t?

**Last-Minute Savior** was built for students who are under **extreme pressure**, panic, and confusion — especially right before exams.

This project focuses on **decision-making**, not planning.

---

## ❓ The Problem

Students at the last minute:
- Feel overwhelmed and anxious  
- Try to study *everything* and end up studying *nothing*  
- Waste time deciding instead of focusing  
- Use planners that increase stress instead of reducing it  

There is no tool that says:
> “Stop. Focus on just one thing. This is what actually matters now.”

---

## 💡 The Solution

**Last-Minute Savior** is **not a planner**.

It is a **survival guide** that:
- Detects panic
- Reduces choices
- Locks focus to one task
- Gives honest, realistic guidance

Designed for **stressed students**, not productivity perfection.

## ✨ Key Features

### 🚨 Panic Mode Detector
- Quick questions detect stress & time pressure
- UI automatically switches to **ultra-minimal Panic Mode**
- Fewer options = more clarity

---

### 🔒 One-Task Lock Mode
- Only **ONE topic visible at a time**
- Other topics are visually locked
- Message: *“Focus on just this one thing right now”*

---

### 🧭 Exam Survivor Path (Not a Timetable)
Instead of long schedules, the plan is shown as **3 clear checkpoints**:
1. **Start Here**
2. **If Time Left**
3. **Optional**

No clutter. No overload.

---

### 🧠 Reality Check System
- Detects unrealistic expectations
- Gently tells the truth:
  > “This is not realistic in the time left.”  
  > “Here’s what is actually possible.”

Supportive, not judgmental.

---

### 🌬️ Mental Reset & Calm Mode
- If panic is detected, app suggests:
  - Short breathing exercise
  - Micro-reset inside the app
- No motivational quotes. Just calm.
